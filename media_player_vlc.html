<H1 CLASS="western">Media_player</H1>
<P>The media_player plug-in plays back a video file. Many formats are
supported, but the playback quality of certain formats varies. The
recommended formats for now are <I>DivX or XVid</I> (avi) and <I>Flash
Video</I> (flv). For successful playback of <I>MPEG</I> (mpg) and
<I>Windows Media</I> (wmv) files, please make sure the files are not
corrupt and the indices of keyframes are intact. If this is not the
case, it will result in choppy playback and skipping audio. The
following options are available:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><I>Video file</I>: A video file from the file pool. Which
	formats are supported depends on your platform, but most common
	formats (such as .avi and .mpeg) are supported everywhere.</P>
	<LI><P><I>Play audio</I>: Specify if the sound that comes with the
	video has to be played. If <I>no</I> is selected, the sound is muted
	during playback of the video</P>
	<LI><P><I>Resize to fit screen</I>: Indicates if the video needs to
	be resized so that it fits the entire screen. If not, the video will
	be displayed in the center of the display in its original dimensions.</P>
	<LI><P><I>Send frame no. to EyeLink</I>: If this PC can connect to
	an SR Research EyeLink, the media player can automatically log the
	number of each frame that is displayed. This makes it easier later
	to analyze the data file per frame. For this to work, it is required
	that the connection to the eyelink has been established already and
	that the OpenSesame eyelink plug-ins are installed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Call custom Python code</I>: In the text field below you can enter 
	custom Python code. With his option you can determine if this code needs to be executed either
	<ol>
		<li>after a key has been pressed during the movie
		<li>after each frame of the movie. 
	</ol>
	For more details, see the bottom of this page.
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Duration</I>: A duration in seconds, 'keypress' (to stop
	when a key is pressed) or 'mouseclick' (to stop when a mousbutton is
	clicked).</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Response collection</H2>
<P>If you enter 'keypress' or 'mouseclick' as a duration, responses
will be logged in the regular way. That is, the following variables
will be set:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><I>response</I></P>
	<LI><P><I>response_time</I></P>
	<LI><P><I>correct</I></P>
	<LI><P><I>average_response_time</I> (or <I>avg_rt</I>)</P>
	<LI><P><I>accuracy</I> (or <I>acc</I>)</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Custom event handling</H2>
<P>If you want, you use your own code to handle keypress and mouseclick events, which should be
entered in the edit field. The PyGame event is passed as 'event'. For example, in order to register if
the spacebar is pressed or if a mousebutton is clicked, you enter:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
        print "Spacebar is pressed"
if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
        print "Mouse button clicked"</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
Please refer to the PyGame documentation for more information:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number of the last played frame is
also available under the variable: frame_no</P>
